---------------------------------------

Cognitive biases that act against our correct estimation of prior probablity: anchoring, ...

Bayesian is sometimes called "subjectivist"

Overconfidence is usual for difficult assessments (although slightly less for T/F tests; Hubbard p64). Underconfidence for easy ones. Calibration fixes this.
1. Rationalize answers with pros and cons (Hubbard p64)
2. Range estimates to reduce the anchoring effect of a point estimate. Particularly, working towards a narrow range for an absurdly large range.
3. Confidence intervals

precision vs recall
sensitivity vs specificity
type I vs type II

positive likelihood ratio = (sensitivity/(1-specificity))
