First, let me throw some [jargon](http://www.woodltd.com/pictures/glossary/door-anatomy1.jpg
) at you. Most doors are [prehung](http://www.lowes.com/pd_519737-42736-LOWOLJW136700179_4294858069__?productId=50019102&Ns): you buy the primed door, hinges and jamb as one unit, with pre-drilled holes for a lock set and strike plate. The unit is fitted into the rough-framed architrave with shims and screwed into place. This save an enormous amount of time in house construction because it decreases the steps needed to hang a door and it decreases the accuracy required for rough framing.

## Demolition ##
The door casing is essentially another layer of trim-board, nailed into the drywall and studs with 15-16 gauge finish nails. I saved and reused these boards in the final product.

</p>

You can see the rough architrave in this picture. I used 1x5 (.75"x4.5") boards to cover space. Prehung doors are sold with a set of shims because this rough frame is usually not level. If your's is not, now is the time to correct that. Luckily, mine was only off by 3-4mm, which was within my 1/4" width tolerance.

Rebuild the top and hinge-side casing and patch the dry wall on other side. The final bookshelf will have the last piece of casing attached to it, so that it can swing out and still provide a flush surface when closed.

Now you can test the footprint dimensions of your bookcase using a piece of cardboard. I choose a footprint of 23.5"x7.5", which allowed me to build the entire shelf with 1x8 dimensional lumber.

Optionally, you can add a cat door with decorative trim.

</p>

The bookshelf will weight ~50lbs. Even after securing the hinges into the door frame with 2-2.5" inch screws, the hinges can only provide stability and should not be load-bearing. Use two rollers under the bottom shelf.

## Lessons Learned ##

* House framing is a very inexact process.
* It's much easier to prime and paint wood <i>before</i> you assemble the bookshelf.
