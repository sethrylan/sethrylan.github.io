After finishing the Khan Academy math exercises in ~80 hours, I made a few notes regarding deliberate practice and its place in online learning media. Khan Academy (KA) focuses far more on rout work that Udacity or Coursera, with most of modules requiring one of 1-3 techniques for solving. The adaptive training plan mostly makes up for this, but one could easily accomplish every KA exercise without any understanding of the background.

Some of the high-level badges (achievements) are impossible (or extremely difficult) to achieve. Since the Atlas Black Hole badge is earned after becoming proficient in 500 skills, and only 367 skills currently exist, it appears that this badge is impossible at this time. My final energy point score was 977,088; also far under the 10,000,000 points needed for the Tesla badge.
