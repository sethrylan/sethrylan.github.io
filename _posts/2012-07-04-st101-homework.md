---------------------------------------

As part of Udacity's [ST101](http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/st101/), I've started completing the homeworks in R using [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/). Below is the solution for homework 2.6:

    print.matrix <- function(m){
      write.table(format(m, justify="right"),
                  row.names=T, col.names=T, quote=F)
    }
    p_loaded = 0.1
    p_hfair = 0.5
    p_hloaded = 0.9
    cells <- c(4, 0,10, 0, 20, 0, 0, 5, 2, 3)
    rnames <- c("# heads", "# tails")
    # creates a list of in form ("#1", "#2", "#n"...) to n=number of trials
    cnames <- c(paste("#", 1:(length(cells)/2), sep = "")) 
    trials <- matrix(cells, nrow=2, ncol=5, byrow=FALSE, dimnames=list(rnames, cnames))
    #print(trials)
     
    # P(fair|flips) = (P(flips|fair) * P(fair))/ P(flips)
     
    for (trial in 1:ncol(trials)) {
      \# joint probablities for fair and loaded coins given observed results
      jp_fair = trials[1, trial] * p_hfair + trials[2, trial] * (1-p_hfair)
      jp_loaded = trials[1, trial] * p_hloaded + trials[2, trial] * (1-p_hloaded)
      if (jp_fair < jp_loaded) {
        print(paste("trial ", trial, " is < 0.5 probable for a fair coin!", sep=""))
      } 
    }
